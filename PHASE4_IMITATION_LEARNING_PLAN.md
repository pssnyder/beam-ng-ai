    # Data augmentation
    - Lateral position shifts (±0.5m)
    - Speed scaling (±10%)
    - Control smoothing/noise injection
```

#### Training Loop
```python
def train_behavior_cloning():
    for epoch in range(100):
        for batch in training_data:
            # Forward pass
            predictions = model(batch.features)
            
            # Loss calculation
            mse_loss = F.mse_loss(predictions, batch.targets)
            l2_loss = sum(p.pow(2.0).sum() for p in model.parameters())
            total_loss = mse_loss + 0.001 * l2_loss
            
            # Backward pass
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            total_loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
